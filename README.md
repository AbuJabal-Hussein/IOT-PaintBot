# IOT-PaintBot
This is a project within the Internet of Things course in the Technion. In which we build a robot that draws pictures on a large scale canvas, controlled by a mobile application that provides an easy drawing interface, and connected via Firebase Realtime Database.

This repository contains code for the 3 components of the project, each in a separate directory.

1. espCode: contains the program required for the ESP8266 WiFi Board.
2. paintingRobot: contains the program required for the Arduino Uno R3 Board.
3. mobileapp/painter_robot: contains the implementation for the flutter mobile application which conrols the robot.

** The files Final_Report.docx Final_report.pdf contain the documentation of the entire project. **
